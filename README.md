[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Mazawrath/beanBOT.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Mazawrath/beanBOT)

beanBOT is my own personal bot that I made for myself, for a discord server I'm in. Although it's not made for public use you can download this repository and use the bot yourself if you want to.

## How to use this bot
- Download or clone this repository.
- Install [RethinkDB.](https://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/install/)
- Set up an application on [discord.](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)
- Add a bot and put in its token as an argument.

## Things to note about this bot
This bot is made for my own personal use. It's currently being used by a streamer and there are a lot of commands made specificly for him such as the one under copypasta and the entire Bean Market. I also have "maza" commands that I use to handle the bot on the streamers discord server. Note that these commands are not specific to me. These commands can only be used by the bot owner. If you really want to use this bot I suggest changing the aliases of the maza commands to suit your own name.

beanBOT is a Java bot that I have made for https://www.twitch.tv/shteeeb. Check him out for #EpicGamerMoments
